# How to Set Multiple End Positions in the Flipgame Editor

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Add a Ball
- Click the "Add Ball" button to create a new ball
- Each ball starts with one end position by default

### 2. Set Start Position (Optional)
- Click the **↓** button (Set start position) for the ball
- Click on any grid cell to set the start position
- A blue status message will appear: "Click on a grid cell to set start position for ball X"

### 3. Add Multiple End Positions
- Click the **+** button (Add end position) for the ball
- A blue status message will appear: "Click on a grid cell to set end position for ball X"
- Click on any grid cell to add that as an end position
- **Repeat this process** to add more end positions
- Each end position will be numbered on the grid (1, 2, 3, etc.)

### 4. Remove End Positions (Optional)
- Click the **-** button (Remove last end position) to remove the most recently added end position
- You cannot remove the last end position (each ball must have at least one goal)

### 5. Visual Indicators
